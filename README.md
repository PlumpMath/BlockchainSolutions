<b>Why it's needed</b><br/>
Email encryption alone is no longer enough, the ability to track email flow as transactions is becoming a necessity now, especially in cases where business is conducted and real-time validation of email flow is required.  Think billing, invoicing, and contract exchange.  We also need a stronger authentication mechanism for user identities. Securing email accounts as we do in cryptocurrency wallets for critical transactions is a necessity today.

In practice, email encryption today is implemented on the email provider level in most cases, GMAIL to YAHOO, etc.  This approach provides in transit security for emails only; it does not take into account many other exposure levels that centralization brings to the table. Additionally, tracking and investigating email transactions is also a complex task today, often requiring access to many internal email platforms and reviewing large amounts of logs for traces of email exchange evidence.  Utilizing email as a tamper proof platform legal exchange medium is held back by this limitation. 

EXPIT research addresses these challenges of with a simple modification to how existing emails can work when we augment SMTP with Blockchain as an additional security layer. EXPITâ€™s Registered Email solution gives the needed option to the user to send an email through the secured or a regular channel. 

<b>How it works </b><br/>
We developed two distinct components to augment email security </br>
1- An outlook plugin that connects to a Blockchain (in this case the Ethereum Ropsten Testnet) </br>
2- A smart contract on Ethereum </br>
